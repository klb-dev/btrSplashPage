# ABOUT


# TOOLS
- HTML - HyperText Markup Language defines structure of content
- CSS - cascading Style Sheets describes the presentation of the HTML document
- Mobile first approach - I created the splash page using mobile first design and then expanding it for different screen sizes.
- Responsive Design is utilizing the different screen sizes for the splash page. Mobile is on column while tablets and desktops can have two or more. 

# RESOURCES 
I am new to the learning Frontend Development and I will say that Google has become a part of my development experience. Experienced developers alway say that Google will become your best friend.

- [Mozilla Document Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a community of developers that help other developers. Being new it is easy for me to understand the syntax of each language with MDN.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) is an organization to help further learning on new trends.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is another resource used by developers. Asking questions sometimes can take a while, but the knowledge on this site is amazing.
- [Kevin Powell - CSS](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) is an amazing teacher of CSS. Any design you want to make can be learned from Kevin.

# What is next
