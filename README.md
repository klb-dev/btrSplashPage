# ABOUT
A splash/landing page for Born to Ride 501(c)(3). It does not fully work because I have not learned how to send the emails to a proper server/database. It has two different view - mobile in a single column and tablet/desktop with two columns.

# TOOLS
- HTML - HyperText Markup Language defines structure of content
- CSS - cascading Style Sheets describes the presentation of the HTML document
- Mobile first approach - I created the splash page using mobile first design and then expanding it for different screen sizes.
- Responsive Design is utilizing the different screen sizes for the splash page. Mobile is on column while tablets and desktops can have two or more. 

# LEARNING
I am still getting the hang of CSS and placement. I have covered quite a bit since I started my software engineer career path of frontend developer. Because I am not using it full-time I still forget certain syntax to place and make sure the project looks good. I am not a designer so truthfully it could use some design. No figma file for looks unfortunately. I am trying to get the design aspect but will need to dive deeper. 

Flexbox is becoming a valuable tool and I continue to get better at all the syntax within flexbox. I feel the media queries are useful and in no are they hard. It is just changing layout or font sizes.

# RESOURCES 
I am new to the learning Frontend Development and I will say that Google has become a part of my development experience. Experienced developers alway say that Google will become your best friend.

- [Mozilla Document Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a community of developers that help other developers. Being new it is easy for me to understand the syntax of each language with MDN.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) is an organization to help further learning on new trends.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is another resource used by developers. Asking questions sometimes can take a while, but the knowledge on this site is amazing.
- [Kevin Powell - CSS](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) is an amazing teacher of CSS. Any design you want to make can be learned from Kevin.

# What is next
I am helping Born To Ride - 501(c)(3) with web development. 
Next up for this project will be to add the functionality of the form. Allow it get the email to BTR server.
